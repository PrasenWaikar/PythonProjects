Implementation idea's of Humanoid Robot 
1.With the help of servo motors and voice commands we can make the robot walk,turn,do hand gestures etc.
2.We can use LED as it's eyes and make it blink as we want.
3.Using NLP and speech recognition we can make the robot talk to us and respond back.
4.Robot can have the power of facial recognition using s/w's & h/w's like openCV,esp32 cam module.
5.Using several sensors our robot can work on the specification of the sensors for example ultrasonic sensor(object detection),flame sensor(flame/heat detection) etc
6.Using LCD screen and emotion detection algorithms our robot will be albe to read our emotions.
